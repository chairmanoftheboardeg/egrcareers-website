      <strong>Important legal notice:</strong> Emirates Group Roblox is an independent virtual organisation and is not affiliated with, sponsored by, or endorsed by any real-world airline, including The Emirates Group. Any similarity in name is intentional for roleplay context only. This document is an internal policy and does not constitute a contract of employment. For binding legal agreements seek professional legal advice.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>1. Purpose & Scope</h2>
      <p>This Employee Rights document sets forth the principles, entitlements and obligations that govern engagement by Emirates Group Roblox (“the Group”). It applies to volunteer personnel, contractors and any individuals engaged by the Group in a capacity that is remunerated or voluntary. The Group seeks to ensure equitable, transparent and safe conditions of engagement in a remote, online context.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>2. Classification of Engagement</h2>
      <p>Individuals engaged with the Group will be classified explicitly in writing as Volunteers, Contractors or Employees. Classification determines remuneration, hours, entitlements and applicable legal protections. Where classification is ambiguous the Group will provide a written clarification upon request.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>3. Equal Opportunity & Anti-Discrimination</h2>
      <p>The Group prohibits discrimination, harassment and victimisation in any form. Recruitment and progression decisions are taken on merit, role-relevant capabilities and conduct. Complaints will be investigated impartially, and corrective measures will be proportionate to the findings.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>4. Recruitment, Selection & Data Handling</h2>
      <p>All vacancies will be advertised through official channels. Applications submitted via the careers portal are retained in the Group’s records for administrative, training and compliance purposes. Personal data is handled in accordance with reasonable privacy practices; requests to access or delete data can be submitted via the Support Centre.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>5. Remote Working Expectations</h2>
      <p>Remote staff agree working hours, availability and communication protocols with managers. The Group publishes HR office hours (Dubai time) for administrative queries. Staff must notify their manager of planned absences.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>6. Remuneration & Expenses</h2>
      <p>Paid roles include remuneration terms in the written contract. Volunteers are not paid unless specified. Reimbursable expenses require pre-approval and valid receipts where applicable.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>7. Confidentiality & Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>Confidential information and Group-owned materials produced in the course of duties are property of the Group unless a separate agreement states otherwise. Staff must not disclose personal or operational data externally without authorisation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>8. Code of Conduct & Disciplinary Measures</h2>
      <p>Staff and members must adhere to professional standards. Unacceptable behaviour may result in disciplinary action including warnings, suspension or removal. The Group will follow an investigatory process prior to severe sanctions where feasible.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>9. Grievance, Appeals & Dispute Resolution</h2>
      <p>Concerns should be raised to HR in writing. The Group will investigate, provide the opportunity to respond, and issue a reasoned outcome. Parties may seek mediation if internal resolution does not resolve the matter.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>10. Termination & Notice</h2>
      <p>For contractual roles termination entitlements are defined in the contract. For volunteers termination for cause may be immediate where necessary to protect the Group or community. The Group seeks to act transparently and provide reasons where practicable.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>11. Liability & Indemnity</h2>
      <p>The Group operates a virtual environment; participants accept that activities are voluntary and that the Group is not legally responsible for personal decisions made by individuals acting independently. Where applicable, contractors indemnify the Group against claims arising from conduct that breaches agreed standards.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>12. Governing Law & Jurisdiction</h2>
      <p>Where disputes arise that require legal determination, parties will generally refer the matter to the courts or mediation appropriate to the jurisdiction specified in a written contract. This document is framed for remote engagements and is not a substitute for jurisdiction-specific legal advice.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>13. Amendments</h2>
      <p>The Group may revise these terms; material changes will be communicated. Continued engagement after publication of changes implies acceptance.</p>
    </div>
