    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>4. Recruitment & Selection</h2>
      <p>Vacancies are advertised on the careers site and official channels. Applicants are selected based on transparent criteria and job-relevant competencies. HR will provide reasonable feedback and an application status on request.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>5. Remote Work & Availability</h2>
      <p>Remote staff must agree working hours with managers. HR office hours (Dubai time) are published on the careers portal. Reasonable adjustments are considered; staff must communicate planned absences in advance.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>6. Pay, Expense & Payment Terms</h2>
      <p>Contracted roles include payment schedules in the contract. Volunteers are not automatically paid. Expenses will only be reimbursed where pre-approved and supported by receipts or valid proof.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>7. Confidentiality, Data Protection & Privacy</h2>
      <p>Employees must not disclose confidential Group data, user information, or private communications. The Group stores personal data required for HR functions; requests to access or delete personal data should be submitted to Support. The Group will make reasonable efforts to comply with applicable privacy laws.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>8. Code of Conduct & Professional Standards</h2>

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>10. Grievance & Disciplinary Procedures</h2>

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>11. Termination</h2>

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>12. Health, Safety & Online Security</h2>

    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>13. Dispute Resolution</h2>
      <p>Where disputes cannot be resolved through HR, the parties may request an impartial review. For legal matters, parties may seek external mediation or legal counsel.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>14. Amendments</h2>
      <p>The Group may update these terms. Material changes will be communicated through official channels. Continued engagement implies acceptance of updated terms.</p>
