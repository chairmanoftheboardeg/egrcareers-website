  <section class="panel-section" id="employee-rights">
    <h2>Employee Rights — Terms & Conditions</h2>
    <p class="section-lead">These Employee Rights apply to all staff and applicants of Emirates Group Roblox working remotely from the United States. They are designed to be legally clear, comprehensive, and printable.</p>

    <div class="employee-terms">
      <h3>1. Employment Status & Classification</h3>
      <p>All employees of Emirates Group Roblox are considered remote contractors unless explicitly stated otherwise in a signed contract. The classification determines eligibility for benefits, leave, and other legal protections.</p>

      <h3>2. Equal Opportunity & Non-Discrimination</h3>
      <p>We are committed to providing equal employment opportunities regardless of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, age, disability, or veteran status. Harassment or discrimination of any kind is strictly prohibited.</p>

      <h3>3. Compensation & Payroll</h3>
      <p>Employees are compensated in accordance with the agreed rates in their contract. Payments are made through approved payment methods on a monthly basis. Any discrepancies must be reported to HR within 15 business days.</p>

      <h3>4. Working Hours & Time Zones</h3>
      <p>As a remote US-based employee, you are expected to maintain communication during agreed working hours in alignment with team schedules. Flexible schedules may be approved by HR. Dubai local time is referenced for HR office availability.</p>

      <h3>5. Leave & Absences</h3>
      <p>Employees are entitled to unpaid leave for personal reasons or emergencies. Requests must be submitted in advance where possible. Unauthorized absences may impact performance evaluations.</p>

      <h3>6. Confidentiality & Data Protection</h3>
      <p>All company data, project information, and personal details of users must remain confidential. Unauthorized sharing is grounds for immediate termination. Employees must comply with GDPR, COPPA, and US data protection regulations as applicable.</p>

      <h3>7. Intellectual Property</h3>
      <p>All work created during employment with Emirates Group Roblox remains the intellectual property of the company. Employees are prohibited from distributing or selling company-related assets without written authorization.</p>

      <h3>8. Code of Conduct</h3>
      <p>Employees must act professionally, ethically, and respectfully. Harassment, bullying, or abusive behavior towards colleagues or community members will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.</p>

      <h3>9. Health & Safety</h3>
      <p>Although remote, employees are encouraged to maintain a safe and ergonomic workspace. Reporting any virtual or digital threats to systems or data is mandatory.</p>

      <h3>10. Termination & Notice</h3>
      <p>Either party may terminate the contract with prior notice as outlined in the signed agreement. Termination due to breach of terms may occur immediately. All final payments will be issued within 30 days of contract end.</p>

      <h3>11. Grievances & Reporting</h3>
      <p>Employees may report grievances or complaints to HR confidentially. All reports are investigated promptly and fairly, with protections against retaliation.</p>

      <h3>12. Amendments & Updates</h3>
      <p>The company reserves the right to update employee policies. Employees will be notified of changes and expected to comply with the most recent version.</p>

      <h3>13. Remote Work Legal Compliance</h3>
      <p>All employees must comply with US labor laws, tax reporting obligations, and any state-specific requirements. HR will provide guidance but employees are responsible for individual compliance.</p>

      <p>These terms are designed to protect both the employee and the company. Employees should read, understand, and retain a copy for reference.</p>
